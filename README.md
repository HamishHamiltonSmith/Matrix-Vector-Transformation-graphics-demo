# Matrix-Vector-Transformation-graphics-demo

## Description

I have been going through 3 blue 1 brown's excellent linear algebra series, and decided why not make some of my own visualisations of the concept. This is not in its final state. I hope to update this repo, in the future you may see linear system of equations content and possibly 3D transforms. 

## Use

To use, clone this repo. The comments in the code will tell you what elements you can change to preform desired transforms. They can be continuous transforms like rotating shapes or event based. When you are happy and run the code, press enter in the output console and for event based things click on the window to preform the transform. 

Have fun!
