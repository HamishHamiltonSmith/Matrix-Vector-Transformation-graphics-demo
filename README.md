# Matrix-Vector-Transformation-graphics-demo

*Description*

I have been going through 3 blue 1 brown's excellent linear algebra series, and decided why not make some of my oen visualisations of the concept. This is not in its final state. As I develop my understanding I hope to update this repo, in the future you may see linear system of equations content and possibly 3D transforms. This isn't anything major, just a bit of fun.

*Use*

To use, look at the comments in the code, they will tell you what elements you can change to preform desired outputs, it can be continuous transforms like rotating shapes or event based. When you are happy and run the code, press enter in the output console and for event based transforms click on the window to visualise them. Thank you and have fun!
